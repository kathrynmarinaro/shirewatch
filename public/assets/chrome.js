/* Page chrome: wires the hamburger on every screen.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THIS FILE EXISTS BECAUSE THE MENU SHIPPED DEAD.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * lib/layout.php's page_menu() rendered the button and assets/menu.js exported
 * attachMenu(), and nothing ever called it. Every screen had a hamburger that
 * did nothing, on every module, and the tests did not catch it because they
 * asserted menu_items() returned items — not that anything consumed them.
 *
 * The fix is structural rather than a line added to each screen's script:
 * page_foot() loads this file itself, so a new screen cannot forget it, and
 * there is no per-screen wiring to leave out.
 *
 * THE ITEMS COME FROM PHP, as JSON in the page. menu_items() in lib/layout.php
 * stays the single source of truth — hardcoding them here would be a second
 * list that drifts the first time one changes.
