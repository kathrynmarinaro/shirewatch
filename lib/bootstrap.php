 * pins the MySQL connection to the same zone at connect time; between the two,
 * PHP's time() and MySQL's NOW() cannot land on different days at midnight.
 *
 * Explicit rather than inherited from the server: Hostinger's PHP default and
 * its MySQL default are configured independently and neither is guaranteed to
 * be the zone the person using this app lives in. A one-day skew here is not a
 * subtle bug — it is birthday cards arriving late, every time, with nothing on
 * screen to explain it.
 *
 * The fallback is UTC rather than the server default, so a config.php missing
 * the key produces one wrong-but-consistent answer instead of a clock that
 * shifts when the host is reconfigured. (cfg() is declared further down this

 * value doesn't error, it just quietly stops busting the cache and you spend an
