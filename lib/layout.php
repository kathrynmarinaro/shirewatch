 * there are, and nothing else in the app enumerates them.
 *
 * Today is leftmost because it is the tab opened daily and the thumb reaches
 * that corner, following the same reasoning Grocery used for its own order.
 * People is the reference book you go to on purpose. Add is a destination, not
 * a habit, so it takes the far corner.
 *
 * vCard import is NOT a tab and is NOT part of Add. It lives in the hamburger
 * menu (page_menu(), below), which is where the Inspiration Gallery and Book
 * Tracker already keep export — app-level things you do once rather than
 * daily. Importing a contacts file would otherwise spend a permanent quarter
 * of the tab bar on a job you do twice, ever, and burying it inside Add would
 * make the Add screen two unrelated things wearing one name.
 *
 * person.php is not here on purpose. It is pushed from Today or People and
 * marks whichever tab it came from active — it is a detail view, not a section.

 *

 * there is no version on it, so the browser serves whatever copy it already
 * has. FOREVER. The entry point updates and the modules underneath it do not.
 *
 * This shipped. A trash button was added to every row, the stylesheet updated
 * (asset() covers CSS), the button appeared — wired to a cached swipe.js that
 * had never heard of it. A control that is visibly there and does nothing, with
 * nothing in any log, and "it works on my machine" being literally true because
 * the developer's browser had no old copy to keep.
 *
 * An import map remaps the resolved URLs before any module loads. Keys are
 * document-relative, matching what './swipe.js' resolves to from
 * /assets/<screen>.js, so this keeps working if the app ever moves into a
 * subdirectory.
 *
 * Fails safe twice over: a browser with no import-map support ignores it and
 * behaves exactly as before, and the Cache-Control rule in .htaccess makes the
 * browser revalidate anyway. Neither is trusted alone — the header needs
 * mod_headers, and a silently absent module is how this class of bug happens in
