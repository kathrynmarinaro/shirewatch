/* Single-password auth on top of a long-lived PHP session.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE GATE IS ON. Every screen in this app is private — there is no public
 * surface, no embeddable view and no second role. One password, one person.
 *
 * It gets its OWN session cookie name (see auth_start_session()), so signing in
 * or out here never disturbs the RSS Reader or Grocery on the same host — the
 * brief asks for that explicitly.
 *
 * Setting it up:
 *   1. php tools/make-hash.php
 *   2. paste the hash into config.php as 'password_hash'
 *
 * It fails OPEN when no hash is configured — see require_login_page(). That
 * matters more here than in any sibling: a leaked grocery list is embarrassing,
 * this database is everyone you know, their addresses and their birthdays. An
 * unconfigured deploy is a PUBLIC deploy.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Ported from Grocery, which ports it from Book Tracker, which ports it from
 * the Workout Generator, which ports it from the Inspiration Gallery. All five
 * share this app's stack and threat model (one password, public internet, no
 * user table). Keep them in sync when any one is fixed — the throttling logic
 * was hard-won.
 *
 * Ported from GROCERY specifically, because Grocery is the only one of them
 * that has auth_attempt_delay() factored out as a pure function. The others
 * have that arithmetic inline inside auth_attempt_login() and therefore
 * untested; Grocery's CLAUDE.md flags it as worth backporting. We inherit the
 * good version, and tools/run-tests.php exercises the curve.
 *
 * Deliberately DROPPED in the port:
 *   - Book Tracker's public-page concept. Nothing here is public, so there is
 *     no require_admin()/public split to make: one gate, called by everything.
 *   - The Workout Generator's guest passcode and role system. Single user, and
 *     this is the one app in the suite with nothing you would ever share. */
