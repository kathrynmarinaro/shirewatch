/* Outgoing email: the one thing this app does that you are not looking at.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ONE FUNCTION IS THE CONTRACT (PLAN.md §7.1).
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *   send_reminder_email(array $person, string $type, string $dueDate): bool
 *
 * Everything else in this file exists to build that message or to explain why
 * it did not go. Nothing outside this file knows that PHPMailer exists, which
 * is the point: swapping the transport later — for a hand-rolled SMTP client,
 * for an API — touches this file and nothing else.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY SMTP AND NOT mail().
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * A message pushed through mail() from a shared host arrives in spam often
 * enough that you would stop trusting the reminders, and a reminder you do not
 * trust is worse than no reminder: you still get the mail, you just stop
 * reading it. The brief asks for SMTP for exactly this reason.
 *
 * PHPMailer is VENDORED AS THREE PLAIN FILES in lib/vendor/PHPMailer/, required
 * directly below. No Composer, no autoloader, no build step — they FTP up with
 * everything else, which is what the suite's no-build-step rule is actually
 * about (not needing a toolchain, rather than not using anyone else's code).
 * Those three files are third-party and are kept byte-identical to the upstream
 * release; do not restyle them to match the house rules, and do not "fix" them.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE FAILURE THIS FILE IS MOST AFRAID OF.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * FROM_EMAIL THAT DOES NOT MATCH USER. Gmail rewrites or outright rejects a
 * From address it has not authorized, and the bounce is silent from this app's
 * point of view: the send "succeeds", the ledger records a delivery, and the
 * mail never arrives. Nothing on any screen would ever say so. It is checked
 * before the connection is opened (mailer_config_problem()), it is asserted by
 * tools/send-test-email.php, and it is in DEPLOY.txt in capitals.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE CLOCK.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Every function here takes $today, exactly as lib/reminders.php does and for
 * the same reason — "next Tuesday" and "62 days ago" are what the subject line
 * SAYS, so a one-day skew is a lie printed on a lock screen.
 *
 * send_reminder_email() takes it as an OPTIONAL fourth argument, so that the
 * three-argument contract above still holds and the one sw_today() in this
 * file is the fallback nobody should reach. The cron passes its own $today, and
 * the tests pass a fixed one. */
