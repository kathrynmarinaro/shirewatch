 * WHY THIS SCRIPT EXISTS AT ALL.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * The cron runs at six in the morning while you are asleep and its only output
 * is an exit code. If SMTP is misconfigured you find out by NOT getting a
 * maintenance reminder — which looks exactly like not having any task due, or
 * like the app being fine and you having forgotten. There is nothing on any
 * screen that can tell you the difference.
 *
 * So this sends one real message through the real mailer, over the real
 * connection, to the real address, and says out loud what happened. Run it once
 * after deploying and once after ever touching the smtp block.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE ASSERTION THAT MATTERS MOST IS THE ONE THAT DOES NOT SEND ANYTHING.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * from_email MUST equal user. Gmail rewrites or outright rejects a From address
 * it has not authorized, and the bounce is silent from this app's point of
 * view: the send succeeds, the ledger records a delivery, and the mail never
 * arrives. It is the single most common way this setup fails, and it is the one
 * failure that looks like success from every angle inside the app. Checked
 * before the connection is opened, and named in the output either way — a check
 * that is silent when it passes is a check you do not know ran. */
